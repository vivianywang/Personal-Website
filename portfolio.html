    <h1>STEM PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <h2>Model House</h2>
    <img/src = 'assets/house.jpeg' alt="My Model House with the light system working">
    <p>This is a mini house I made for a camp a couple years ago. I made the frame of the house with popsicle sticks and the walls with styrofoam. I then wired a lighting system and a water pipe system. Finally, I coded the different components for the house and added some visual decorations.</p>

    <h2>Rover Bot</h2>
    <img/src = 'assets/rover.jpg' alt="Rover bot on my desk">
    <p>This is a robot that I made last year for myself. It moves on its own, and when it encounters an obstacle, it changes its route. It is made of a box, wheels, a sensor and lots of wires. I put all these components together then coded what was needed as well.</p>

    <h2>Culinary Compass App</h2>
    <img/src = 'assets/app.png' alt="Welcome page of Culinary Compass">
    <p>This year, I made an app called the Culinary Compass that allows users to explore different foods from around the world and also has a personality quiz feature. There is an interactive map as well, to give the user the most understanding possible. I made it for a Kode With Klossy summer camp a couple weeks ago. </p>
